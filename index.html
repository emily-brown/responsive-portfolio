    <img id="container" src="assets/images/profilepic.jpg" alt="Profile Picture" width="200px" height="200px"><p>Hi! I'm Emily and I'm a mom of 2 fur-babies. They're two black cats who, at times, can be the biggest trouble makers, but are also absolute sweethearts. They're names are Gin and Tonic (yes, that also happens to be my favourite drink!).

    In case you couldn't tell by my profile pic, I love to eat (and cook)! I love to travel not only to take in the beautiful scenes and cultures, but also because of the food. Food is so unique to every place I visit and helps immerse you in the culture and history of wherever you are. I encourage everyone to step outside of their comfort zones when it comes to food and try something different you wouldn't get at home (also helps when you have a good glass of wine to wash it all down with)!
